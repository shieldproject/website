<h1>Previous Calls</h1>

<p>We don't record the roadmap calls, but we do take copious amounts of notes
and attempt to summarize them below.  Wouldn't your rather skim a report
<em>on</em> a meeting, rather than watch a static recording <em>of</em> the meeting??</p>

<h2 id="20200123">January 23nd, 2020</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our fifth community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Thursday, January 23nd, 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></p>

<h2>Spring 2020 Roadmap Goals</h2>

<p>Our main goals for SHIELD in 2020:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Scalability:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We currently are hitting a ulimit of about 180 agents.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be exploring Postgres as a replacement for Sqlite to better
handle the database lockout problem with lots of agents.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be looking to stop writing task logs to the database to further
reduce strain on the database.</p></li>
<li><p>One of our goals is HA SHIELD. (Externalize vault/scheduler).</p></li>
<li><p>Active ssh fabric for agents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Containers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Continued improvements with SHIELD on k8s via helm.</p></li>
<li><p>Move bosh release to the containers release + SHIELD docker image.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to CI/CD to reflect new packaging </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>After reviewing our roadmap we had discussions about some of the obstacles that
we need to overcome to accomplish our goals for 2020. We talked at length about how
we should best handle our transition from Sqlite to Postgres.</p>

<h2 id="20190822">August 22nd, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our fourth community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Thursday, August 22nd, 2019.</p>

<h2>Rebooting the Roadmap Call</h2>

<p>Sometimes life happens, and gets in the way of other things.  We're okay now
though, so the SHIELD Team is going to resume the Roadmap Calls monthly.</p>

<h2>SHIELD v8.4 is out &mdash; v8.5 On The Horizon</h2>

<p>The SHIELD Team released <a href="v8.4">version 8.4</a> of SHIELD on August 9th, and is
busily preparing for a mid-September release of <a href="v8.5-mile">version 8.5</a>.</p>

<h2>etcd!</h2>

<p>Stark &amp; Wayne sponsored an internship over the Summer of 2019 in which four
enterprising University of Buffalo CS Students built a backup plugin for
CoreOS' etcd key-value system.  Congratulations to Sriniketh, Pururva,
Jason, and Naveed!</p>

<h2>Website Redesign</h2>

<p>This is our website, but you may not recognize it.  We just got a nifty
new redesign.  Now that the day-to-day annoyance of modifying the website
content is more well-in-hand, the team expects to start putting up more and
more blog posts and documentation!</p>

<h2>Blogs, Blogs, and More Docs!</h2>

<p>The SHIELD Team has been putting forth a concerted effort to write more
approachable "first timer" content to get people interested in deploying
SHIELD to protect their valuable cloud data assets.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time of our next Communty Call (September 26th), we'll
have something more concrete to show off.</p>

<h2 id="20180913">September 13th, 2018</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our third community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Thursday, September 13th, 2018.</p>

<h3>New BackBlaze Storage Plugin</h3>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Dan Molik (Stark &amp; Wayne), the SHIELD
project now has support for storing backup archives in BackBlaze's B2
endpoint, via the new <code>b2</code> storage plugin!</p>

<h3>Download (and re-encryption) of Backup Archives</h3>

<p>The SHIELD Team is working on building new functionality into SHIELD for
(securely) downloading archives from Cloud Storage, via the web interface
or the CLI.</p>

<p>This used to be a lot easier in SHIELD v6, but when we introduced
encryption into the mix, we lost the ability to inspect individual
archives.  Furthermore, SHIELD complicates the issue by randomizing the
keys and initialization vectors (IVs) for <em>each archive</em>, and stores them
in the local Vault, which operators do not have access to.  Even for
"fixed-key" backups, the key that the operators are given is used to
<em>derive</em> the key and IV used to encrypt the archives.</p>

<p>To remedy this, and yet maintain the security of archives, SHIELD is
being extended to include a new API endpoint for downloading and
re-encrypting a single archive (subject to tenant rights and access
control).  This new endpoint will take encryption parameters from the
operator, and re-encrypt the archive as it is streamed from storage.</p>

<h3>Open Forum</h3>

<p>Jordan and Phillip asked several very good questions.  Good on them!</p>

<p><strong>Smoking Hole SHIELD Restores</strong> - <em>Do we have documentation for the
recovery of a SHIELD core itself?</em></p>

<p>We have a process, and it's sort of documented, but not well.  We're
working on fleshing out the <a href="/docs/latest/ops/manual">SHIELD Operations Manual</a>
with these details.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication Tokens</strong> - <em>Authentication Tokens seem to be tied to
individual SHIELD user accounts.  Do those persist across SHIELD
re-deployments?</em></p>

<p>Yes, Authentication Tokens are tied to individual accounts.  Behind the
scenes, those are implemented as non-expiring sessions associated with
the user who created them.</p>

<p>Because they are resident in the sessions table in the database, they
should persist across BOSH deploys, assuming (a) you are using
persistent disks and (b) you are not deleting the BOSH deployment
first.</p>

<p><strong>Bootstrapping Local Users</strong> - <em>Can The SHIELD BOSH Release Bootstrap
Local Users?</em></p>

<p>No it cannot, but it should.</p>

<p><strong>Mutual Network Visibility of SHIELD Agents</strong> - <em>In v6, the only
communication channel was unidirectional, wherein the SHIELD core
connected to each SHIELD agent to orchestrate a baackup.  This does not
seem to be the case in v8.</em></p>

<p>This isn't really a question, but we'll let that slide.</p>

<p>In v8, the SHIELD core still initiates an SSH session to the agent
involved to orchestrate it.  What's new in v8 is an HTTPS registration
ping from the agents to the core.  This "ping" puts the agent in the
SHIELD core's database, so that the core can SSH back into the agent
and retrieve metadata from them.</p>

<p>This poses a severe problem with NAT'ed installations which lack the
required <em>mutual network visibility</em> to make this work.  What we (Stark
&amp; Wayne) have been doing is just colocating the SHIELD core in the same
NAT "scope" as the systems being orchestrated.</p>

<p>We've designed a few alternatives to this.  One is a SHIELD-aware NAT
traversal proxy that would handle connections to/from the agents across
the NAT boundary.  This is a fair bit of engineering work, but it does
preserve backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>A far superior solution is to break backwards compatibility, and invert
the orchestration flows.  If the SHIELD agents SSH into the SHIELD
core, announce themselves, and then await orders, we can handle both
the metadata retrieval / agent discovery, and traverse NATs with ease.</p>

<h2 id="20180809">August 9th, 2018</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our second community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Thursday, August 9th, 2018.</p>

<h3>Lean Table View</h3>

<p>SHIELD now supports a Lean Table View, for collapsing lots of cards into
a more compact, tabular view.  We'll be working on making that view also
available on the wizards (configure backup, run ad hoc, and restore).</p>

<h3>Optional Compression</h3>

<p>Bzip2 Compression of archives is now optional.  The implementation makes
it modular, so we can add in new compression schemes (gzip, zip, lzma,
etc.)</p>

<h2>Plugin Reference Documentation</h2>

<p>We've started documenting the <a href="/docs/latest/ops/plugins">SHIELD Plugins</a> and
their configuration.</p>

<p>Thanks all for joining!  See you next month!</p>

<h2 id="20180712">July 12th, 2018</h2>

<p>These are the notes for our first ever community call, held at 11:00am EDT
on Thursday, July 12th, 2018.</p>

<h3>The Website</h3>

<p>We have a website at <a href="https://shieldproject.io">https://shieldproject.io</a>.</p>

<p>We are putting all of our documentation, guides, and manuals there</p>

<p>Work is underway on fleshing out the
<a href="/docs/latest/ops/manual">SHIELD Operator's Manual</a>, and the
<a href="/docs/latest/ops/plugins">Plugin Reference</a>.</p>

<p>We're also hoping to build out recipe-based docs like
<em>How do I backup Cloud Foundry?</em></p>

<h3>The Trello Board</h3>

<p>We have started using a <a href="https://trello.com/b/qLZCvexK/shield">Trello Board</a> for coordinating developer
activity.  If you want to get involved in hacking on SHIELD, ask in
the #help channel on <a href="/community#slack">Slack</a>.</p>

<p>Github Issues will still be the place to report bugs and ask for feature
requests.  Trello is more for things that require multiple different
states, prioritization, backlog management, etc.</p>

<p>Every month we will be highlighting delivered features and fixed bugs
that we feel are important enough to announce (big, operator-visible
stuff), and discussing our focus for the next month.</p>

<h3>Current Future Direction</h3>

<p>We've got a lot of minor bugs in the Trello backlog; we're focusing on
those first, to get them fixed and get the fixes shipped.</p>

<p>We've also conducted an internal review, which we're calling <em>Gap
Analysis</em>.  Put simply, it's all the things we haven't finished, and all
the features we know we need but haven't implemented.  This includes
things like being able to edit systems from the web interface, viewing
tasks, rescheduling backup jobs, etc.</p>

<p>Once we've got the bug backlog tamed, we'll be moving onto the gap
tickets.</p>

<h3>Release Cadence</h3>

<p>We're hoping to hit a weekly release schedule with SHIELD, the SHIELD
BOSH release, and the SHIELD Genesis Kit.  Our current plan is to cut new
point releases on Friday afternoons.</p>

<h3>Open Forum</h3>

<p>Jordan asked a bunch of questions.  Thanks, mate!</p>

<p><strong>CLI Help Documentation</strong> - <em>Curious whether or not we were going to
provide more documentation for CLI usage, either via the website, or
inline via <code>--help</code> flags.</em></p>

<p>Short answer: yes.</p>

<p>Long answer: definitely yes, via both methods.  We'll review the state
of SHIELD help inside the CLI, and see if there are logical places to
flesh out what we've got, cover more abstract topics, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Can SHIELD itself be recovered via the CLI only?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, no.  The SHIELD recovery mechanism (with the fixed key
backup) relies on visual elements that are part of the Web UI.
However, it's a good feature (one we're missing, so it's a "gap"),
and we'll be looking into support for that particular workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Archive Management</strong> - <em>Having deleted archives manually from
backing cloud storage, Jordan noticed that the SHIELD Web UI didn't
update its storage usage counts.</em></p>

<p>This is normal, and we'll address it specifically in the documentation,
since SHIELD expects to have full and complete control over cloud
storage.  We did talk through a UI view (CLI and Web) for browsing cloud
storage archives, and deleting them there, with an eye towards reclaiming
space.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring and Notifications</strong> - <em>Is it possible to notify about storage
usage limits being reached, failing storage, failing jobs, etc.?</em></p>

<p>Short answer: yes, via the <code>/v2/health</code> endpoint, in an external
monitoring system.</p>

<p>Long answer: we have plans for a separate project / product, for handling
notifications more globally, with business logic and dispatch rules built
into <em>that</em> system, which SHIELD would then integrate with.</p>
