        <h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Docker images are now compiling via the go 1.13 toolchain.</p></li>
<li><p>Agent Registration can now occur through chained load balancers,
with standards-compliant comma-separated X-Forwarded-For
headers.  Why you would want to do this is beyond me, but ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>metashield</code> plugin now trusts system X.509 Root CAs if no
specific CA is supplied.</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap restoration is simpler now, and the UI for init /
restore is more streamlined.  See #680.</p></li>

      <h1 id="v8.6.3">SHIELD v8.6.3</h1>
      <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Web UI, when sorting, is now case-insensitive.</li>
<li>The data-system-specific storage footprint in the Web UI now no longer
counts purged archives against the storage footprint.</li>
<li>The core no longer leaks a SQL prepared statement when making requests
to the SQLite3 backend, fixing an unbounded memory leak.</li>
<li>The migration to database schema v12 now reports errors more granularly.</li>

      <h1 id="v8.5.0">SHIELD v8.5.0</h1>
      <h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>shield status</code> command is twice as pretty and three times
as useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud Storage detail pages in the web interface now show a
timeline similar to the one shown for Data Systems, so that
SHIELD operators have an easier time of troubleshooting failing
storage configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>The SHIELD CLI now displays task+log data for the last
test-store task of a given store (for <code>shield store X</code> and
<code>shield global-store Y</code>), to assist in troubleshooting failing
storage configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Operators now have a web interface and some CLI commands for
inspecting the state of SHIELD Data Fixups, and re-running them
(if / when necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mongo</code> target plugin can now have options applied
individually to just <code>mongodump</code> or <code>mongorestore</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Passwords and RSA private keys are now properly obscured in
the web interface detail pages for both systems and cloud
storage.  People without rights to see such credentials will
still see the "REDACTED" string instead; but people with the
required privilege will instead see the blurred-out obscured
text that they can hover over to reveal.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield tasks</code> command can now filter down to only tasks
that involve a particular tenant or global cloud storage system.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Data Fixups will now be properly skipped if they've already been
applied.  Additionally, names / dates / summaries will be
updated <em>every time</em> the SHIELD Core boots up, to catch typos
and mispellings there.</p></li>
<li><p>The Data System detail page in the web interface no longer has a
race condition between the start of an AJAX call for the plugin
configuration details and a <code>shield:navigate</code> away from the
page.  Other such race conditions involving AJAX should now also
be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching between tenants (with differing levels of access) now
properly re-renders the sidebar to show your new privileges.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield job X</code> command now populates the "Status" and
"Agent" fields, using data in the API responses.</p></li>

      <h1 id="v8.4.1">SHIELD v8.4.1</h1>
      <h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added a /v2/mbus/status API endpoint that returns metrics about the state of
the event message bus. This allows for some introspection into what websocket
connections may be doing at that moment.</li>
<li>The UI now has less wasted space when displaying a bunch of cards for data
systems.</li>
<li>Implemented a configurable timeout when making SSH connections to agents. A
lower default now also keeps dead agents from taking up large amounts of
scheduler worker time.</li>
<li>SHIELD now tracks when the last time an agent erred was.</li>
<li>Hidden agents are now sorted under a separate header in the web UI.</li>
<li>Hiding, showing, and deleting agents can now be done from the CLI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>We no longer leak the file descriptors and goroutines for detached websocket
clients</li>
<li>Workers can no longer be starved out when sending events to the message bus
if the receiver of the message bus is misbehaving because these event sends
are now asynchronous.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a worker could derefence a nil pointer when certain
database selects returned no rows.</li>
<li>The database layer now has more stringent locking, which both avoids certain
threads locking each other out in SQLite, and also makes certain series of
database operations effectively atomic.</li>
<li>A couple of fixups would deadlock themselves out of the database and prevent
fixups from actually running. Now they don't.</li>
<li>Fixups now only run once instead of on every startup, like nature intended.</li>
<li>The agent "Last Checked At" timestamp was being updated when the task was
pulled off the scheduler, whether or not the agent was actually checked
(due to other potential errors).</li>
<li>Named a fixup without a name.</li>
<li>Agents that failed their status checks are now once again marked as such.</li>

      <h1 id="v8.3.0">SHIELD v8.3.0</h1>
      <h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Submit buttons on forms now (a) disable themselves when clicked
and (b) change their text to indicate an ongoing operation.
This greatly increases the usability of the web UI.  See #505</p></li>
<li><p>The web UI for rekeying SHIELD Core now correctly identifies
when the operator would like to rotate the fixed key.  Also, the
error messaging for an incorrect <em>current</em> master password is
better now, and by default, the "rotate fixed key" checkbox on
the rekeying form is off.  See #546</p></li>
<li><p>The default password for the failsafe account has been changed
from <code>shield</code> to <code>password</code>, for more continuity across various
packaging formats.  See #531</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield tasks</code> command (and the backing API) can now filter
tasks based on their task type (i.e. "backup", or "restore")
See #523</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Encryption</code> column of the system detail page's backup jobs
table now <em>always</em> shows something.  For jobs that do not used
the fixed key, the new tag is <code>randomized</code>.  See #536</p></li>
<li><p>SHIELD now tracks when it last checked each agent separately
from when it last "saw" the agent.  <em>Last Seen</em> now means the
point in time when the agent last connected to the SHIELD core,
and <em>Last Checked</em> is when the core last connected to the agent
for metadata retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p>SHIELD now allows agents to change their IP address; only the
agent name is unchangeable.  Previously, attempts to change an
agents registered IP address (without changing its name) would
fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the SHIELD Agent and the SHIELD CLI now trust the system
X.509 CA Certificate Stores.  See #555 and #556</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The MotD separator no longer displays if the MotD is empty
or not specified.  See #530</p></li>
<li><p>The Ad Hoc Backup and Restore wizards now handle the "empty"
state more gracefully, and instead of showing an empty table
when there are no data systems, they warn you that you have
no systems to backup or restore.  See #532 and #533</p></li>
<li><p>Stores (global and tenant-specific) can now be properly deleted
via the web UI and CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>When editing targets and stores on the webui changes are now
persisted when editing again without a refresh.</p></li>
<li><p>The "Agents of SHIELD" admin page no longer gets stuck in a
loading loop whenever websocket events are seen.</p></li>
<li><p>Global Storage Configuration details are now properly loaded
when accessing a global store detail page from the admin panel.
Previously, the details would only load if you visited the
global store from the "Storage Systems" (non-admin) top-level,
which only works if you actually have a tenant.  See #535</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield annotate-archive</code> now works with short uuids</p></li>
<li><p>Orphaned archives from a target deletion no longer prevent users
from loggin into SHIELD</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mongo</code> plugin now handles hosts with embedded ports,
allowing operators to configure multi-node mongo across
different ports on the same node, without <code>--port</code> getting in
the way.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mongo</code> plugin now allows you to authenticate against a
database <em>other</em> than "admin" (which remains the default).</p></li>

      <h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>swift</code> plugin now supports the Openstack v3 Identity API</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>vault</code> plugin now supports k/v v2 endpoints, which are
now the default in contemporary versions of Vault.</p></li>

      <h1 id="v8.1.0">SHIELD v8.1.0</h1>
      <h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The SHIELD Web UI now allows you to download the SHIELD CLI
directly, for both MacOS (Darwin) and Linux.  From now on,
SHIELD releases will include the paired version of the CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>We now support minutely backups, but only from the CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>New <code>shield op pry</code> for decrypting and inspecting the contents
of a SHIELD Vault Crypt.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>SHIELD now cleans up the Vault when archives are marked as
expired (for purgation).</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled jobs no longer "stack" in the queue.  If SHIELD goes
to schedule a backup and an existing task is in-flight for the
same job, an already-cancelled task is stored in the database,
as a placeholder to the task that should have run.</p></li>
<li><p>Storage Health Check Tasks no longer stack.  SHIELD only allows
one in-flight task for a given Cloud Storage System, at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield</code> CLI now handles API endpoints with any number of
trailing forward slash (<code>/</code>) characters.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Web UI page dispatch logic now properly cancels all outstanding
AJAX requests, to avoid a rather annoying lag/delay UX issue
where pages would flip "back" to a previous node in the history,
because a delayed AJAX request was still working away in the
background.</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield import</code> now honors the <code>paused</code> setting on jobs that it
creates on your behalf.</p></li>
</ul>
