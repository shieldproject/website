      "notes": "SHIELD v8 is a marked improvement over previous version of SHIELD.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n  - *Multi-Tenancy* - SHIELD now supports the notion of tenants, which allow\r\n    site operators to group their users logically, and sequester teams from\r\n    one another.  Each tenant has its own set of jobs, tasks, archives,\r\n    etc., and members of one tenant cannot interact with the resources of\r\n    another.  Users can be assigned to multiple tenants, concurrently.\r\n\r\n  - *Archive Encryption* - SHIELD now leverages AES-256 encryption when\r\n    storing backup archives in cloud storage, making sure that your data is\r\n    secure, even at-rest.\r\n\r\n  - *Agent Registration* - SHIELD Agents now register with the SHIELD Core,\r\n    and provide metadata to assist operators in the configuration of backup\r\n    targets, and cloud storage systems.\r\n\r\n  - *Improved Web UI* - SHIELD's web-based user interface got a massive\r\n    overhaul in this release, with a concerted focus on efficiency and\r\n    ease-of-use for operators, and their immediate concerns.\r\n\r\n  - *New CLI* - The SHIELD CLI has been rewritten from the ground-up to\r\n    interface more cleanly with the SHIELD v8 API.  It handles plugin\r\n    configuration more naturally, without forcing you to write proper JSON.\r\n    Yay.  It also supports a new `import` function that makes it easy to\r\n    ensure that your target and storage systems, jobs, retention policies,\r\n    etc. are always correct.\r\n\r\n  - *Improved Scheduling* - Backup Jobs can now be run every X hours, much\r\n    to the delight of SHIELD users everywhere.",

This keeps\r\n  the task list from growing with lots of tasks that will not be\r\n  scheduled until later.  For `purge` tasks this wasn't a huge\r\n  deal, but for `test-store` it meant that cloud storage would get\r\n  slammed with test after test after test after test as soon as\r\n  the SHIELD was unlocked.\r\n\r\n# Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The `fs` plugin no longer functions as a store plugin.  This\r\n  configuration was deemed to dangerous in the wild, given the\r\n  locality constraints.  If you need local-ish filesystem-backed\r\n  storage, check out the `webdav` plugin.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- WebSocket broadcast receivers are only registered _after_ a\r\n  successful upgrade from plain HTTP to WebSockets, to avoid\r\n  stalling out the core on badly-behaved clients.\r\n\r\n- The CLI now honors `-k` everywhere it appears.\r\n\r\n- It is now possible to update a target / store that was created\r\n  without any configuration (no `--data` on create-*).\r\n\r\n- CLI update-* commands now properly display the updated object\r\n  attributes, instead of an empty report.\r\n\r\n- The `create-auth-token` CLI command now honors `--json`.\r\n\r\n- Fix javascript event handler stacking bugs in the web UI.  In\r\n  short, form submissions would \"remember\" their previous onsubmit\r\n  handlers, leading to some _very_ interesting errors on both\r\n  client- and server-side.",

Previously, the existing schedule was in\n  force until the first run after a schedule change, at which\n  point the new schedule kicked in.  This was weird, so we changed\n  it.\n\n- New Cloud Storage Solutions (global or tenant-based) are\n  considered healthy until proven broken.\n\n- `shield-agent` now has better logging to help troubleshoot\n  registration problems.\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix an egregious bug in the scheduling logic that was only\n  considering jobs scheduled in the future to be \"overdue\".\n  Since all jobs start out with a next_run of 0, this caused NO\n  JOBS to ever be scheduled.  Thankfully, 8.x is still beta.\n\n- Fix a segfault when dereferencing a nil Task during a broadcast.\n  Now, we log that we got a nil task, to assist in tracking down\n  why / where its occurring, rather than just crashing on panic.\n\n- The `shield restore-archive` command now prints out the UUID of\n  the task scheduled to run the restore, rather than the cryptic\n  (and oh-so-unhelpful) string \"%s!:bool=true\"\n\n- Neither `shield create-job`, nor `shield update-job` will allow\n  you to create (or modify) jobs to have invalid, unparseable\n  schedules.  This will keep the CLI from accidentally creating\n  schedules that the web UI can't process.\n\n- When restoring through the new wizard, the web UI only shows\n  archives for the selected target system, instead of all of the\n  archives every made for the tenant.  Turns out this was less\n  than useful.\n\n- Fix up some edge cases where we weren't checking for the\n  existence of a tenant in tenant-scope API calls, just the rights\n  to that tenant -- since system users can affect all tenants, we\n  found that we could create child objects on non-existent\n  tenants.\n\n# Developer Stuff\n\n- `bin/testdev` now runs a WebDAV service on the nginx reverse\n  proxy (on `$PORT+1`), since we can no longer use the `fs` plugin\n  for storage operations.\n\n  On MacOS, with homebrew, you'll want to reinstall nginx with\n  WebDAV support: `brew reinstall --with-webdav nginx`\n",

See #514.\n\n- The core scheduler now immediately fails any task for which the\n  remote SHIELD agent does not signal a successful (rc=0) exit\n  status.  This should clean up some task logs, and remove red\n  herring issues like JSON unmarshal failures, while\n  simultaneously ensuring that failed purge tasks are re-tried.\n  See #518.\n\n- Purge tasks are now being properly supplied with the restore key\n  necessary for deleting the archive blob.  See #516.\n\n- Agent Status tasks (op `agent-status`) were not previously being\n  created with proper global tenant association.  This prohibited\n  operators from viewing the details of those tasks.  We fixed\n  this, and added a data fixup created to re-associate existing\n  tasks.  See #522.\n\n- The HUD now always registers the global cloud storage in its\n  health data, so operators are aware of all issues with storaage\n  systems that they might be using, global or tenant-private.\n  See #504.\n\n- Jobs created via the Web UI now properly set their \"KeepN\"\n  attribute, which was missing from the ingestion / insertion.\n  Accompanying this is a new data fixup that should re-calculate\n  the `keep_n` database field wherever it is zero.  See #460.\n\n- Unlocking SHIELD was not properly giving feedback when a wrong\n  password was given or no password at all. This is now working.\n  See #524.\n\n- Previously we had issues doing a fs backup and restore of SHIELD\n  itself. Improvments to the fs plugin, and fixing permissions issues\n  within core now allow SHIELD to properly backup and restore itself.\n\n# Improvements\n\n- All `-v` handlers in CLI utilities now properly handle the 'dev'\n  version as analogous to the empty ('') version, and revert to\n  reporting the version of the binary as '(development)'.  This is\n  mainly for packaing Docker images properly.\n\n- All `shield*` CLI utilities, include the `shield` CLI itself,\n  the `shieldd` daemon, and all helper binaries now sport options\n  for getting their usage (`--help`) and versions (`--versions`).\n\n- The `s3` plugin now accepts a URL as its `s3_host` endpoint\n  parameter, affording operators more flexibility.\n  The alternative was confusion!  See #509.\n\n- When purging archives manually, you can now supply\n  human-friendly reasons for the purge.  For example, if the data\n  is known to be bad in that particular vintage of the target\n  system, you can purge the archives containing it, and explain\n  that.  See #520\n\n- Archives can now be annotated from the command-line, with the\n  `annotate-archive` command.\n\n- Manually purged archives now track their reason for purge as\n  \"manually purged\", instead of \"expired\".  See #517.\n\n- All system- and tenant-level objects can now be searched for,\n  and referenced by short UUIDs.  This is huge (though short),\n  going a long way to making the CLI easier to work with.\n\n# Release Engineering\n\n- Docker images can now be built with embedded release versions,\n  for non-dev distribution as a container image.\n",

See #505\n\n- The web UI for rekeying SHIELD Core now correctly identifies\n  when the operator would like to rotate the fixed key.  Also, the\n  error messaging for an incorrect _current_ master password is\n  better now, and by default, the \"rotate fixed key\" checkbox on\n  the rekeying form is off.  See #546\n\n- The default password for the failsafe account has been changed\n  from `shield` to `password`, for more continuity across various\n  packaging formats.  See #531\n\n- The `shield tasks` command (and the backing API) can now filter\n  tasks based on their task type (i.e. \"backup\", or \"restore\")\n  See #523\n\n- The `Encryption` column of the system detail page's backup jobs\n  table now _always_ shows something.  For jobs that do not used\n  the fixed key, the new tag is `randomized`.  See #536\n\n- SHIELD now tracks when it last checked each agent separately\n  from when it last \"saw\" the agent.  _Last Seen_ now means the\n  point in time when the agent last connected to the SHIELD core,\n  and _Last Checked_ is when the core last connected to the agent\n  for metadata retrieval.\n\n- SHIELD now allows agents to change their IP address; only the\n  agent name is unchangeable.  Previously, attempts to change an\n  agents registered IP address (without changing its name) would\n  fail.\n\n- Both the SHIELD Agent and the SHIELD CLI now trust the system\n  X.509 CA Certificate Stores.  See #555 and #556\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n- The MotD separator no longer displays if the MotD is empty\n  or not specified.  See #530\n\n- The Ad Hoc Backup and Restore wizards now handle the \"empty\"\n  state more gracefully, and instead of showing an empty table\n  when there are no data systems, they warn you that you have\n  no systems to backup or restore.  See #532 and #533\n\n- Stores (global and tenant-specific) can now be properly deleted\n  via the web UI and CLI.\n\n- When editing targets and stores on the webui changes are now\n  persisted when editing again without a refresh.\n\n- The \"Agents of SHIELD\" admin page no longer gets stuck in a\n  loading loop whenever websocket events are seen.\n\n- Global Storage Configuration details are now properly loaded\n  when accessing a global store detail page from the admin panel.\n  Previously, the details would only load if you visited the\n  global store from the \"Storage Systems\" (non-admin) top-level,\n  which only works if you actually have a tenant.  See #535\n\n- `shield annotate-archive` now works with short uuids\n\n- Orphaned archives from a target deletion no longer prevent users\n  from loggin into SHIELD\n\n- The `mongo` plugin now handles hosts with embedded ports,\n  allowing operators to configure multi-node mongo across\n  different ports on the same node, without `--port` getting in\n  the way.\n\n- The `mongo` plugin now allows you to authenticate against a\n  database _other_ than \"admin\" (which remains the default).\n",
