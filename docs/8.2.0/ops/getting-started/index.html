<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Welcome to the SHIELD Getting Started guide.  This document is for
you if you;</p>

<ol>
<li>Care about your data systems</li>
<li>Want to run SHIELD to protect your data</li>
<li>Have access to Docker</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p>After you've run through this guide, you'll have a working SHIELD
installation, with a configured data system, a successful backup
job, an archive, and you'll have run through a restore.  More
importantly, we hope you'll be comfortable working with SHIELD,
and ready to explore more of what you can do with it.</p>

<h2>Deploying SHIELD</h2>

<p>We're going to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">Docker Compose</a> to spin up SHIELD and all
of its components (there's quite a few of them).</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir ~/shield-demo
$ cd ~/shield-demo
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shieldproject/shield/v8.2.0/docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have the compose recipe file locally, let's fire it
up.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>

<p>SHIELD is now running at https://localhost:9009.  If you visit it
in your browser of choice, you should see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/8.2.0/ops/getting-started/login.png" alt="The SHIELD Login Page" /></p>

<p>The default credentials for SHIELD are <code>admin</code> (username) and
<code>shield</code> (password).  After you log in, you will be presented with
the <em>initialization screen</em>, where you'll set your master
password, to protect the encryption parameters of all backup
archives.</p>

<p>After you've set your master password (via the form on the right),
SHIELD generates a <em>fixed key</em> which isn't terribly important
right now but is very important in production.  It's used to
encrypt the backup archives of the SHIELD metadata, for disaster
recovery.</p>

<p><img src="/docs/8.2.0/ops/getting-started/fixed-key.png" alt="The Fixed Key" /></p>

<p>Copy that fixed key into your password manager for safe-keeping
and click the "I Understand" button to continue.</p>

<p>You should now be all logged into SHIELD.</p>

<h2>Your First Backup Job</h2>

<h2>Restoring the Data</h2>

<h2>Backing up SHIELD Itself</h2>

<p>In a disaster recover situations is important to get shield back up and
running as soon as possible to facilitate the restore of the your other
systems.</p>
