<h1>Tenant Lifecycle</h1>

<h2>Tenant Deletion</h2>

<p>If you wish to delete a tenant the shield cli provides you with the <code>delete-tenant &lt;tenant-name&gt;</code>
command that will allow you to delete the tenant provided there is no existing configuration
under that tenant.
Configuration meaning any outstanding:
  1. tasks
  2. memberships
  3. jobs
  4. targets
  5. stores
  6. archives</p>

<p>If you wish to delete a tenant and recursively delete the above configuration use the
<code>delete-tenant -r &lt;tenant-name&gt;</code>command.</p>

<p><em>Note after confirming the deletion, the above will be deleted from shield and archives will be purged from storage.</em></p>
