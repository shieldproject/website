<h1>Github Authentication</h1>

<p>Github can be used as an external OAuth2 provider for controlling
SHIELD authentication and authorizations.  Both public Github
(github.com) and private Enterprise Github are supported.</p>

<p>All you as a SHIELD site operator need to do is configure the
SHIELD Core with a new authentication provider backend, and
register an OAuth Application via the Github web interface.</p>

<h2>Registering a Github OAuth Application</h2>

<p>To start, access the <em>Settings</em> page by expanding the account
fly-out menu underneath your profile picture, in the top
right-hand side of the Github web interface:</p>

<p><img src="github2.png" alt="Accessing Settings : Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Then, access the <em>Oauth Apps</em> panel, under the <em>Developer
Settings</em> header on the left side of the screen:</p>

<p><img src="github3.png" alt="GitHub Setup" /></p>

<p>Then, click on the <em>Register a new application</em> button to bring up
the form for registering your SHIELD to Github:</p>

<p><img src="github4.png" alt="GitHub Setup" /></p>

<p>Then, just fill out the form:</p>

<!-- FIXME: need better screenshots.
            less emphasis on navigation,
            more emphasis on the form to fill out -->

<p>The <code>Authorization callback URL</code> field must be set to:</p>

<pre><code>https://$shield/auth/$identifier/redir
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>https://$shield</code> is the address of the SHIELD instance, and
<code>$identifier</code> is the name you configured the authentication provider
with, via the SHIELD Core configuration file.</p>

<p>Github will generate a new Client ID and Client Secret.  Take note
of these, as they are necessary for the next step.</p>

<h2>Configuring SHIELD</h2>

<p>To configure SHIELD to work with Github, you need to add a new
<em>authentication provider</em> configuration stanza to the SHIELD Core
configuration file:</p>

<pre><code># ... all the other shield core configuration ...

auth:
  - identifier: github  # or whatever you used when registering
    name:       Github
    backend:    github
    properties:
      client_id:      YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-ID
      client_secret:  YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-SECRET

      mapping:  []    # more on this later
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>auth</code> key is a list of all configured authentication
providers; if your configuration already features other providers,
like token or UAA, you will just need to append the Github
configuration to that.</p>

<p>The top-level of each <code>auth</code> item has the following required keys:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>identifier</strong> - An internal name, used by SHIELD to
differentiate this authentication provider configuration from all
of the others.  This is used in the Github Application
Redirect URL, so it should not be changed lightly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>name</strong> - A human-friendly name that will be displayed to
web and CLI users when they are trying to decide which
authentication method they wish to use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>backend</strong> - What provider backend to use.  For Github, this
will always be <code>github</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>properties</strong> - Properties specific to the Github
authentication provider.  Detailed next.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring Github Authentication Properties</h3>

<p>The <code>properties</code> key has the following sub-keys:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>client_id</strong> - The Github Client ID for your registered
OAuth application, available from the Github web interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>client_secret</strong> - The Github Client Secret for your
registered OAuth application, available from the Github web
interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>github_endpoint</strong> - (not shown above) An optional URL where
SHIELD can find the Github endpoint.  This is primarily used
for Enterprise Github customers who run an isolated,
on-premise Github.  Public Github users need not set this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mapping</strong> - A list of rules for mapping Github organizations
and teams to SHIELD tenants and roles.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mappings</h3>

<p>Each element of the <code>properties.mapping</code> list specifies a rule for
translating Github's organizations and teams into SHIELD tenants
and roles.  This rule scheme allows for a great deal of
flexibility in bridging the two systems, allowing you to mix
multiple Github orgs into a single SHIELD tenant, split a single
org into multiple tenants, etc.</p>

<p>The format of each rule is:</p>

<pre><code>- github: Github Organization Name
  tenant: SHIELD Tenant Name
  rights:
    - team: Github Team Name
      role: SHIELD Role
    # ... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>github</code> field matches the Github organization name.  If a
user is found to belong to this organization, the rest of the rule
is processed.  Processing starts by looking through the list of
<code>rights</code>, until a match on <code>team</code> to Github team name is found, at
which point the specified <code>role</code> is assigned to the user, on the
given <code>tenant</code>.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>auth:
  - identifier: github
    name:       Github
    backend:    github
    properties:
      client_id:      YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-ID
      client_secret:  YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-SECRET

      mapping:
        - github: cloudfoundry-community
          tenant: Cloud Foundry Community
          rights:
            - team: Owners
              role: admin
            - team: Engineers
              role: engineer
            - role: operator
</code></pre>

<p>In this configuration, SHIELD will assign someone in the <em>Owners</em>
team of the <em>cloudfoundry-community</em> org to the <em>Cloud Foundry
Community</em> SHIELD tenant, as an <em>admin</em>.  Members of the
<em>Engineers</em> Github team (on the same org) who are not in <em>Owners</em>
will be assigned the <em>engineer</em> role instead.  Everyone else in
the Github org will be assigned the <em>operator</em> role.</p>

<p>These <code>rights</code> rules are processed until one matches; subsequent
rules are skipped.</p>

<p>If there is more than one mapping, each of them is tried, in
order;  this can lead to multiple tenant assignments for a single
user, which provides a lot of power to the SHIELD site operator.</p>

<p>Tenants that do not already exist in the database, but have been
defined in the authentication configuration, will be created as
needed.</p>

<p>Valid values for the <code>role</code> field are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - Full control over the tenant</li>
<li><strong>engineer</strong> - Control over the configuration of stores,
targets, retention policies, and jobs.</li>
<li><strong>operator</strong> - Control over running jobs, pausing and unpausing
scheduled jobs, and performing restore operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The SYSTEM Tenant</h3>

<p>There is a special tenant, called the <em>SYSTEM</em> tenant, that exists
solely to allow SHIELD site operators to assign system-level
rights and roles to Github users, based on the same rules as
tenant-level role assignment.</p>

<p>The <em>SYSTEM</em> tenant has its own set of assignable roles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - Full control over all of SHIELD.</li>
<li><strong>manager</strong> - Control over tenants and manual role assigments.</li>
<li><strong>engineer</strong> - Control over shared resources like global storage
definitions and retention policy templates.</li>
</ul>
